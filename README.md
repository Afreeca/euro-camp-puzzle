## Requirements

Follow the instructions provided in the official documentation for your OS

- Nodejs and npm -> https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## How to run the application

#### Run it Manually

To run the application manually, you need Node.js and npm installed. Follow these steps:

from the root folder (euro-camp-puzzle):

1. install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the frontend UI:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Access the UI Application

Once the application is running, you can access the UI by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Run Unit tests (Jest)

From the root folder:

```bash
npm run test
```

#### Product - technical decision

I decided to use react just because it offers something visual,
but the decision to go with react does not affect the requirement like using Typescript and unit test.
